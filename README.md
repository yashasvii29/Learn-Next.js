# Learn-Next.js
This repository contains my learning journey with Next.js, the React framework for building fast, modern web applications.
It includes hands-on practice with essential Next.js concepts such as:

* File-based routing

* Server-side rendering (SSR)

* Static site generation (SSG)

* API routes

* Dynamic routing

* Styling with Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules

* Deployment with Vercel

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Next.js by creating mini-projects, experimenting with features, and documenting key learnings along the way.
